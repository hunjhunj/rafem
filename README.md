River Avulsion and Floodplain Evolution Model
=======

Morphodynamic river and floodplain model designed to be run standalone or coupled with the [Coastline Evolution Model](https://github.com/pymt-lab/pymt_cem) (CEM) using the [CSDMS](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page) [PyMT](https://pymt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Documentation is currently being updated (4/6/19). Please see our paper, [Exploring Wave and Sea‐Level Rise Effects on Delta Morphodynamics With a Coupled River‐Ocean Model](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JF004757) for a detailed model description.
